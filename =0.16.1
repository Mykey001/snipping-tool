INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of solana to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested solders==0.12.0
    solana 0.30.0 depends on solders<0.16.0 and >=0.15.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
